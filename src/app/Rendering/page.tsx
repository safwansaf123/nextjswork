    <h2>Rendering performed on browser is called Client Site Rendering csr</h2>

<h2>SSR seo friendly (Search Engine Optimization) </h2>
<h2>Convert Build to HTML, CSS, javaSCRIPT ETCC.....</h2>
<h2>it determines how your application handles content fetching and rendering, either on the server or as static files</h2>
<h2>CLIENT SITE RENDERING is done on browser, CLIENT means Browser or front END</h2>
<h2>when we request FRPM CLIENT TO SERVER and server is forexample localhost3000 in response a build is created </h2>
<h2>and this BUIld is shifted on browser </h2>
<h2>from BUILD to creation of the PAGES or we say displaying of the pages on browser is called Rendereing</h2>
<h2>and when this Rendering done on Browser is called </h2><h3>CLIENT SIDE RENDERING </h3>
<h2>when we search on search engine it sends request to our website server in response BUILD is return and in this Build </h2>
<h2>Draw backs of Client site rendereing is SEO down if content not found while searching , website performance down, Computer power or system is utilized higly,</h2>
<h2>computational power is used more beacuse of heavy code if website is heavy</h2>
<h2>and when this rendering done on SERVER is called </h2><h3>SERVER SITE RENDERING</h3>
<h2>Build is run on server or rendering done on server, server already has more RAM more power , easily serached, SEO increased,  </h2>
<h3>by default rendering on next js is server site Rendering</h3>


<h4>What is rendering?</h4>

<li>Rendering, in web development, is the process of converting code into viewable, interactive web content. This involves interpreting the code written in languages like JSX or Vue.js and displaying it as a webpage that users can interact with. This can be done server-side or user-side.</li>

Developers often integrate platforms like Sanity with frontend frameworks that utilize server-side rendering to transform components and structured content into visually engaging websites, thereby enhancing the user experience and site performance.

When leveraging server-side rendering, components are converted into HTML strings on the server before sending them to the browser. This approach, combined with the structured content from Sanity, improves time-to-content performance and search engine optimization (SEO), ensuring that the websites are not only visually appealing but also performant and discoverable.

In addition to server-side rendering, there’s Client-Side Rendering (CSR), where the rendering takes place in the user’s browser. This method allows for dynamic content updates without reloading the page, offering a more interactive user experience, especially for web applications with real-time features.

<li>Considering your web rendering strategy</li>
Rendering is a pivotal step in web development. It comes into play after the coding phase, turning the written code into something viewable and interactive for the end-users.

The choice between server-side and client-side rendering methods depends on the project requirements, with CSR being more suitable for dynamic, interactive applications, and server-side rendering for static, SEO-sensitive sites. This integration of rendering into the development lifecycle on Sanity is essential for delivering polished, high-performing, and SEO-friendly final products.

<li>Getting started with rendering methods</li>
Rendering in web development does have its prerequisites and dependencies. When using JavaScript frameworks, developers need to have an understanding of them, such as Vue.js or React (JSX), as the components are written in these languages. Knowledge of both server-side and client-side rendering and how they impact SEO and performance is also essential.

<li>The impact of different rendering methods</li>
In web development, rendering has a profound impact on user experience and SEO.

Platforms integrated with Sanity can leverage both server-side and client-side rendering to optimize websites and applications for performance and discoverability. When implemented effectively, this combination can lead to enhanced user engagement, reduced bounce rates, and improved potential for higher search engine rankings.

By leveraging different rendering methodologies effectively, developers can create visually engaging, interactive, and high-performing websites and applications. This, in turn, contributes to the overall success of the web development project, ensuring that the final product meets both user expectations and business goals
